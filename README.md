# EcoCAR - Vehicle Detection and Collision Prevention

The purpose of this project was to implement a simple collision detection and prevention algorithm for a car travelling on a three lane highway. The simulated car will prevent collisions by monitoring the distance and speed neighbouring vehicles. This project was originally created as a submission for EcoCAR at McMaster University.
